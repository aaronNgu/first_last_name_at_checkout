Once installed, the single "Name" field is automatically replaced by
separate "First name" and "Last name" fields on:

- The checkout address form (``/shop/address``)
- The portal account details page (``/my/account``)

Both fields are mandatory. Whitespace-only values are rejected.

No configuration is required.
